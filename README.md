### 零散笔记

* Go 包中的公共方法名或公共属性，首字母必须大写，否则会被认为是私有的。Go中已经不需要public或者private
* you can use **git merge --abort** to take the branch back to where it was in before you pulled.
* The **git rebase** command allows you to easily change a series of commits, modifying the history of your repository.it's considered bad practice to rebase commits when you've already pushed to a repository.
